# Jupyter Keymap for (all) Notebooks

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.jupyterpowertools) that provides Jupyter keyboard shortcuts for all Notebooks.

* Why create another extension when these keyboard shortcuts are already supported in Jupyter Notebooks (via Jupyter Extension)?
    * The goal is to have the same keyboard shortcuts for all notebooks, not just Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.
* What about Jupter Extension Keyboard Shortcuts
    * This extension will will disable keyboard shortcuts contributed by the Jupyter extension.
    ```json
    "jupyter.enableKeyboardShortcuts": false
    ```
